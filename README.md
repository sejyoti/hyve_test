Description of the Decoding Algorithm


The decoding algorithm is an implementation of a (non-injective) function that
takes a sequence Cs back to its decoded form s.
Starting with an empty result bytestring, read the encoded pair sequence (with
length n) from the left (i = 0) to the right. For each pair read, if pi = 0, append
qi to the output stream. Otherwise, pi > 0. Read the last pi characters appended
to the result string and take the first (from the left) qi characters.
For example, the following sequence:
(0, 61), (1, 1), (0, 62), (3, 2), (3, 3) (2)
would result in the bytestring ✻✶ ✻✶ ✻✷ ✻✶ ✻✶ ✻✷ ✻✶ ✻✶ (represented here in
hexadecimal) through the sequence [✻✶], [✻✶ ✻✶], [✻✶ ✻✶ ✻✷], [✻✶ ✻✶ ✻✷ ✻✶ ✻✶] ((3, 2) means go back three characters, in this case to the first position, and take
the first two characters afterwards), and finally [✻✶ ✻✶ ✻✷ ✻✶ ✻✶ ✻✷ ✻✶ ✻✶].
The hexadecimal values ✻✶ and ✻✷ become the characters ❛ and ❜ when interpreted as text. So the final output, when converted from bytes to text, is the string
❛❛❜❛❛❜❛❛. However for the purposes of this assignment the conversion from bytes
to text is out of scope and irrelevant, we will effectively be dealing with binary
data only.



Input of the Program
On input, the program will receive, on standard input, an encoded data stream.
There are no restrictions on the length of input data; indeed, it can be unbounded.



Output of the Program
The program should write:
• To standard output, the decoded binary data. If any invalid or incomplete
pair is found, the byte ✸❋ should be output in its place.
• To standard error, the result of re-encoding the decoded data produced in
the above step. Write two implementations, a trivial one that always uses
pi = 0 and a better one that produces an output as short as you can manage.The program should default to the latter and only switch to the first one if
the environment variable ❯❙❊❴❚❘■❱■❆▲❴■▼P▲❊▼❊◆❚❆❚■❖◆ has value ✶.
It is left undefined how much data the program should buffer before decoding
or re-encoding data.
